  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      unique type Foo

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

  change:
  
    ⍟ These names already exist. You can `update` them to your
      new definition:
    
      unique type Foo
